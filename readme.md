# Hacking Compendium
This hacking compendium has the objective to gather different exploits, tools, bf-databases for all red teaming over there. We hope to contribute to the community with well-known scripts that had work during different engagements.

The structure of this repo is as follows:
 * **auxiliaries:** Like on metasploit framework, this auxiliaries are scripts that may help you to uncover new stuff about your target. They are not directly exploits.
 * **bruteforce-database:** This is a self-explanatory folder; These are different well-known brute force dictionaries to use with your favorite software.
 * **exploits:** This folder contains different exploits for different known vulnerabilities. We are not going to add zero-days nor private exploits;
 * **portables:** It's always useful to have a portable version of some softwares to just drop them on a target machine an execute it!
 * **scanners:** Different tools to scan networks, vulnerabilities, files, etc. We are not going to upload tools that are already on pentestings machines (like WPScan, Dirbuster, etc...).
 * **shells:** Here is a list of different shells orderded by technology. Good to have them somewhere.  

Feel free to contribute with your own scripts and tools or with community based tools to this repo! Or just clone it into your [Parrot Machine](https://www.parrotsec.org/) or your [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/).
