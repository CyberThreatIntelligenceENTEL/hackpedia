# Hacking Compendium
This hacking compendium has the objective to gather different exploits, tools, bf-databases for all red teaming over there. We hope to contribute to the community with well-known scripts that had work during different engagements.

## Structure of this repo
The structure of this repo is as follows:
 * **auxiliaries:** Like on metasploit framework, this auxiliaries are scripts that may help you to uncover new stuff about your target. They are not directly exploits.
 * **bruteforce-database:** This is a self-explanatory folder; These are different well-known brute force dictionaries to use with your favorite software.
 * **exploits:** This folder contains different exploits for different known vulnerabilities. We are not going to add zero-days nor private exploits;
 * **portables:** It's always useful to have a portable version of some softwares to just drop them on a target machine an execute it!
 * **scanners:** Different tools to scan networks, vulnerabilities, files, etc. We are not going to upload tools that are already on pentestings machines (like WPScan, Dirbuster, etc...).
 * **shells:** Here is a list of different shells orderded by technology. Good to have them somewhere.  

## Contribute
Feel free to contribute with your own scripts and tools or with community based tools to this repo! Or just clone it into your [Parrot Machine](https://www.parrotsec.org/) or your [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/).
